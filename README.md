# Drugbank_Xml_Parser
Xml_file parser for the drugbank data.

The Drugbank has a huge collection of drugs(~13k) with all the information about each of them. All the data is available in a XML downloadable file - https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest.

Created some APIs that would help to retrieve information from that XML file.
